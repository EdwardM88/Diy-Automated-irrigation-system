# Diy-Automated-irrigation-system
In this project I created an simple,but very useful irrigation system,with two big modes,manual using an IR remote,an automatic,based on more sensors.
More details about project are presented in documentation.


#Functionality of project:
  * Irigation modes controled by a remote controler;
  * Automatic irrigation modes based on results from sensors;
  * simulation in real life;

#Sturcture of project

#Using project 
  *Connect elements of project like my circuit diagram
  *Read carefully the documentation,i change some thinks
  *Uploade the code

#Simulation
