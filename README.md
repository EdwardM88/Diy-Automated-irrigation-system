# Diy-Automated-irrigation-system
In this project I created an simple,but very useful irrigation system,with two big modes,manual using an IR remote,an automatic,based on more sensors.


#Functionality of project:
  * Irigation modes controled by a remote controler;
  * Automatic irrigation modes based on results from sensors;
  * simulation in real life;

#Sturcture of project
 * circut: 
 * code: (https://github.com/EdwardM88/Diy-Automated-irrigation-system/blob/b3fc879b8d8c02f8b95ad84541c4a1875c96adb7/sistemIrigatie.ino)
 * full docs: 

#Using project 
  *Connect elements of project like my circuit diagram
  *Read carefully the documentation,i change some thinks
  *Uploade the code

#Simulation
